                            This activity is funded with capital from ORG Holdings’ principals and third party non-institutional investors.
                            Through its successful development, ownership, operation and management of this diverse portfolio, ORG Holdings’ principals have gained considerable skills and hands-on real estate experience which provides an added dimension to the advice provided to clients.

                            In 2001, upon expiration of Mr. Schwartz’s non-compete agreement with his prior employer, ORG Holdings commenced providing real estate investment advice on a retainer basis to institutional investors.
